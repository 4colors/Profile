  CHANGELOG

  1.5.3
    Changed the permission for the view function from 'Profile:view:' to the 
        more standard 'Profile::view', and also removed the double permission requirement
        for the view function (Read access needed only for 'Profile::view' not for 
        both that AND 'Profile::'). (issue #55)

        *** NOTE: If your current permission set includes 'Profile:view:', then
            it must be changed to 'Profile::view'.
